## Lessons Learned

Firstly I would like to present my gratitude from the core of my heart to the team at FamPay for giving me this opportunity! A Big Thank You!

This assignment was a journey of countering fears. I learnt several new concepts like pull down to reload, contextual cards which slide vertically and many more, some of which I used to fear from. 

Team at FamPay is a big inspiration ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ú® since they're working for a very noble cause that is Financial Literacy and Financial Inclusion starting from teenagers which was neglected for a very long time. My best wishes to everyone in FamPay! Always your biggest Fanboy ü§ü
